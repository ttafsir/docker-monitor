# Virtual lab tools

Simple utility scripts to manage `vrnetlab` and `containerlab` based virtual labs.

## Utilities

* `docker_health.py`: Check the health of the `vrnetlab`-based docker containers. This is useful if you're looking to wait the containers to be ready before running tests.
* `clab_testbed.py`: Create a `containerlab` testbed for pyats based on the generated ansible inventory.
